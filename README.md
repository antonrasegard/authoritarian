# Authoritarian

This website is made for an author in my proximity and for her personal and professional use. The project name Authoritarian is just a word play - nothing malign.

## Technologies Used

- [HTML] This project uses HTML as its base language.
- [CSS] This project uses CSS for bits that require personal styling.
- [Bootstrap](https://bootstrap.com) This project uses basic Bootstrap for default styling, but I've tried hard to limit the use of Bootstrap after talking to my mentor. It is better if the CSS is personalized and not dependant on an external library which could become outdated at any time.
- [JavaScript/jQuery] 
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) 
- [GoogleFonts](https://fonts.google.com) 
- [Google Image Search](https://google.com)
